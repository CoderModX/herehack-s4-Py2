# herehack-s4-Py2
Here Technology Hackathon. Project Based on Prediction of House/Land Prices based on Geo Location Data and then use the data and visualize over maps.

# Problem Statement
Predict land/house prices based on the geo location data and visualize over maps.

# Proposed Solution
To predict land/house prices based on the geo location data and visualize over maps we will be using python to train models on a given dataset or previous datasets with years of data about different land/house prices in different areas. After training the model we will use here technologyâ€™s api to fetch data about different parts of the country and plot the location of the houses in the map and show the prices just above the location as a label. Also we will try to determine whether the property is undervalued or overvalued.
